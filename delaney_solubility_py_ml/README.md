# Delaney Solubility with Descriptors Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing data and creating a solubility model based on Delaney's criteria. The analysis utilizes the attributes provided in the dataset, aiming to develop a comprehensive understanding and predictive model of solubility.

### Key Objectives
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conduct a thorough analysis to evaluate data integrity and identify features with significant correlations.
- **Model Development**: Implement a stacked modeling approach to predict solubility.
- **Model Optimization**: Refine the model by adjusting the number of foundational models and the diversity of features.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn` etc.
- **Machine Learning**
- **Notebook Environment**: JupyterNotebooks
